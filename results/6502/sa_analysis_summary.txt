- Runtime: 58.36s

### Recommended Balanced Configuration:
- Cooling Rate (α): 0.95
- Moves per Temp: 200
- Final HPWL: 440976 site units
- Runtime: 206.87s
- Balance Score: 0.810

## Pareto Frontier Analysis
The Pareto frontier contains 5 configurations that represent optimal trade-offs between quality and runtime.

### Parameter Correlations:
- Slower cooling (higher α): Generally improves HPWL but increases runtime
- More moves per temperature: Improves HPWL but significantly increases runtime
- Initial temperature effect: Fixed at 10.0 in experiments
- Refine probability effect: Tested at 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9

## Recommendations
1. **For best quality**: Use α=0.99, moves=200 (accept longer runtime)
2. **For fastest execution**: Use α=0.85, moves=200 (accept quality trade-off)
3. **For balanced performance**: Use α=0.95, moves=200 (recommended default)

The analysis shows a clear trade-off between solution quality (HPWL) and runtime, with the Pareto frontier providing guidance for selecting appropriate parameters based on project requirements.
